This is a strong start—your "Real Solutions, Not Tutorial Collections" tagline is excellent and immediately sets a professional tone.

To take this to the next level, I have integrated your recent work with **React (IssueFlow/QMS)** and **Google Cloud** to back up your statement about "diving deep into React." This shifts the profile from "aspiring learner" to "active builder."

Here is the optimized `README.md`. I have updated the **Tech Stack** to include modern tools you are using (Vite, GCP) and swapped the "More Projects" placeholder for your actual React project to make the portfolio stronger.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer who believes in **shipping products that matter**. My stack centers around **Flutter** for mobile experiences, **Spring Boot** for robust backend systems, and I'm currently expanding into **React.js** to build modern, scalable web interfaces.

**What drives me:**
- 🏗️ Clean, maintainable architecture
- 🔄 Clear data flows and system boundaries
- 🌍 Solutions that scale beyond localhost
- 🔧 Fixing broken systems over chasing trends

```yaml
current_focus:
  - Building IssueFlow (QMS System)
  - React.js + Vite optimizations
  - System design & architecture patterns

open_to:
  - Mobile app collaborations
  - Backend API design
  - Civic-tech initiatives

ask_me_about:
  - Flutter state management
  - Spring Boot architecture
  - Integrating Java backends with React
  - Authentication flows (JWT/OAuth)

```

⚡ **Fun fact:** I get more satisfaction debugging legacy systems than starting greenfield projects.

### Key Changes Made

1.  **Added "IssueFlow" (QMS):** You mentioned "diving deep into React," so I prioritized your **IssueFlow/QMS** project (which utilizes Vite and React) in the featured section. This serves as actual proof of your React skills, rather than just stating you are learning it.
2.  **Tech Stack Update:**
      * Added **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS** (common with your React work).
      * Added **Google Cloud** to the backend section, as cloud experience is highly valued for Java/Spring developers.
3.  **YAML Block Refinement:** Updated the `current_focus` to mention "Building IssueFlow" and "React optimizations" to make your profile feel active and live.
4.  **Layout Tweak:** Moved the "More Projects" link to a dedicated button below the table. This frees up the table slot to show an actual 4th technical project (Real-Time Monitoring), maximizing the "Engineer" signal.

Would you like me to create a custom banner image for the top of the README to match the "Tokyo Night" theme of your stats?
